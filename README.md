Drug Reviews Visualization

## ðŸ’Š Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing patterns in the Drug Review dataset. The goal is to uncover trends in patient feedback, highlight which drugs receive the most attention, and understand how user experiences vary over time.

The visualizations provide actionable insights for both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, showing not only which drugs dominate patient discussions but also how patients express satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

## ðŸ“Š Key Visual Insights

### 1. Top 10 Drugs with Most Reviews

- Levonorgestrel dominates, followed by Etonogestrel and Ethinyl estradiol combinations.
- Majority of top drugs are contraceptives or hormonal therapies, reflecting strong patient engagement in reproductive health.
- Antidepressants such as Sertraline and Escitalopram also rank high, showing mental healthâ€™s importance in patient reviews

### 2. Distribution of Drug Ratings

- Ratings follow a U-shaped pattern.
- Majority are 10/10 (very positive) or 1/10 (very negative).
- Neutral ratings (4â€“6) are rare, suggesting patients mostly review when they had extreme experiences.

### 3. Review Length vs Rating

- Median review length is similar across all rating levels.
- Some outliers show long, detailed reviews for both positive and negative experiences.
- Indicates that engagement (length) is not strongly tied to rating.

### 4.Trends Over Time (Yearly Reviews)

- Reviews rose steadily between 2008â€“2014.
- Sharp spike in 2015â€“2016, possibly linked to increased adoption of online health platforms.
- Slight decline post-2016, potentially due to platform maturity or changing patient behavior.

### Conclusion
Contraceptives and antidepressants dominate patient discussions.
Ratings are polarized, with most users leaving reviews only for extremely good or bad experiences.
Review length is not tied to rating intensity.
Review activity peaked in 2015â€“2016, hinting at shifts in how patients use online platforms for drug feedback.

ðŸ“Œ These insights can help pharma companies track drug reputation and healthcare providers anticipate patient concerns.
